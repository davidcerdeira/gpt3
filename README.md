## Description
This is a modern GPT-3 inspired website I built with React and CSS. While developing it. my goal was to focus on the fundamentals off CSS properties to master flex & grid, soft animations and media queries for responsiveness whilst trying to keep a modern design.

Alongside building this website, here are some of the topics I was able to practise and the technologies I worked with:

- React Functional components and their reusability
- React file and folder structure
- Fundamental CSS properties (flex & grid)
- Fundamentals of the CSS BEM Model
- From soft and pleasant animations
- Complex gradients
- Perfectly placed media queries for satisfactory responsiveness
